# MtzMaterials
MTZ Materials is an embedded web application, scale house system used to emulate weighing semi-trucks. It includes a Raspberry Pi used to host a web application and an Arduino Uno that uses an HX711 module and a load cell sensor. The technologies involved are Python(Flask, SQL-Alchemy, SQLite) and Arduino C. 

## The problem I am Solving
With a shortage of truck drivers, there is a high demand for transporting cargo. With that, it is crucial to keep the trucks within the federal weight limit, of 80,000 pounds or 40 tons. An overloaded truck is dangerous to operate and can cause harm to the roads and other drivers. With a scale house system, this can be prevented, by preventing an order from being completed if the truck is over the weight limit. This will keep the drivers and scale house operators responsible for their weight limit.
